# Something you're building · Build in Public

Building {something}, our {x} at {x}, is all about clarity.
3 design rules I follow:

1. Minimal UI
2. Neutral colors + one accent
3. Space > clutter

An MVP is not a product. It's a **conversation starter**.
Goal: show just enough so people say "I’d use this tomorrow."
