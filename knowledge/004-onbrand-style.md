# On-Brand Copy Style

Tone: direct, human, tech-savvy.  
Style: short insights + one clear CTA.  
Lexicon: flows, iterate, MVP, clarity, ship fast.

Example:
Hook → "Discipline beats motivation — but hunger makes it inevitable."  
Insight → "Build flows, not features. Your CRM doesn’t need 20 tabs; it needs 3 actions done fast."  
CTA → "What’s the one flow you can simplify today?"
