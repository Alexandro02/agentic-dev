# AI Tools I Actually Use

AI tool for devs → Neovim or Vscode
Copilot with GPT 4.1 or Claude Sonnet 4.1

AI tool for design → Relume ai (turn a brief description into UI mockups).
Perfect for MVPs like {x} or any other SaaS.

AI tool for productivity → Notion AI | Perplexity AI.
Summarizes docs while I focus on building.

Takeaway → AI is not the product. It’s leverage, a hack to get faster results.
